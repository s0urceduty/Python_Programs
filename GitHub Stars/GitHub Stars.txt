The "GitHub Stars" project is a lightweight, Flask-based web API application designed to fetch and display comprehensive statistics about a GitHub user. Hosted on Vercel, it leverages the GitHub API to retrieve user profile information, repositories sorted by star count, and a snapshot of recent public contributions. Upon receiving a request at the /api/github-stats endpoint with a GitHub username, the app responds with a structured JSON object containing detailed metrics such as the user’s login, bio, followers, and the number of public repositories. Additionally, it provides a list of repositories ordered by stargazers, offering insights into the most popular projects the user maintains. To ensure secure access to GitHub’s API, the application uses a personal access token, which is loaded from environment variables via a .env file.

From a technical perspective, the project is modular and extensible, making it suitable for integration into dashboards or analytics platforms. The GitHub_Stars.py file defines core functions for retrieving user data, repositories, and public activity, with robust pagination to handle large repo lists. It calculates the total number of stars across all repositories and formats the results for clarity and utility. By sorting repositories based on star count and limiting the number of events in the contributions section, the application emphasizes high-value content. The inclusion of deployment and setup instructions in the README ensures that developers can easily clone, configure, and deploy the service using Python 3.8+, Flask, and a Vercel account. This makes the project an effective tool for developers, recruiters, or enthusiasts who want quick insights into a GitHub user’s influence and activity.
