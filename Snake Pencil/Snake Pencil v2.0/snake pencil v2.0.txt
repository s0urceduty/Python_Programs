Snake Pencil V2.0 introduces a complete transformation from V1.2, making it smoother, faster, and more user-friendly. One of the most significant upgrades is the integration of a unified movement system for both manual and AI-controlled movement. In V1.2, the player-controlled snake moved in a grid-like manner, responding instantly to key presses with predefined speeds. Meanwhile, AI movement followed preset patterns like circles, spirals, and figure eights, resulting in a clear disconnect between manual and automatic movement styles. In contrast, V2.0 eliminates this inconsistency by implementing acceleration and deceleration mechanics, ensuring that both AI and manual movement feel natural and fluid. Now, whether the player is drawing manually or using AI, the snake follows the same smooth motion rules, giving the user greater control over creative expression. The AI movement in V2.0 is no longer rigid—it can freely explore the canvas while maintaining organic motion, rather than following strict predefined paths as in V1.2. This makes AI-driven drawing feel more dynamic and less predictable, allowing for unique and artistic outputs every time.

Another major improvement in V2.0 is the introduction of a speed mode button, which allows users to switch between Slow, Normal, and Fast speeds directly from the interface. In V1.2, speed adjustments relied solely on holding the Shift key, limiting flexibility and forcing users to use keyboard controls to change the snake’s movement speed. Now, with a dedicated speed mode button, users can seamlessly adjust their speed during drawing sessions, whether they prefer precise slow movements for detailed designs or fast movement for quick sketches. This improvement makes V2.0 significantly more accessible to users who prefer touchscreen or mouse-based interactions over keyboard shortcuts. Additionally, AI speed is now customizable, meaning that auto-drawing can operate at different paces depending on the user’s preference. This level of control was missing in V1.2, where AI speed was fixed and could not be adjusted dynamically. The new speed toggle makes Snake Pencil more versatile, catering to both artists who need precise control and users who prefer fast, freehand drawing.

A game-changing addition to V2.0 is the image capture button, making it incredibly easy to save drawings as PNG files. In V1.2, capturing images was done by pressing the P key, and files were often overwritten due to repeated saves with the same filename. This made it difficult to keep multiple drawings in one session. In V2.0, the process has been entirely redesigned with a dedicated "Capture" button that allows users to save their work instantly without needing a keyboard shortcut. Additionally, saved images are now automatically assigned unique filenames based on timestamps, preventing file overwrites and ensuring that every drawing is properly stored. This makes V2.0 far more practical for users who want to archive, share, or refine their artwork over multiple sessions. The enhanced image capture feature also improves creative workflow, allowing users to effortlessly preserve their designs with just one click—something that V1.2 struggled with due to its limited saving options. With these upgrades, V2.0 marks a major leap forward, transforming Snake Pencil from a simple creative game into a fully functional digital drawing tool with intuitive controls, fluid movement, adjustable speeds, and seamless image-saving capabilities.
