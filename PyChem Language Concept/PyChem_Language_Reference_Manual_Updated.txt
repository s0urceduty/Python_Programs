# PyChem Language Reference Manual

## Overview
PyChem is designed to intuitively express and compute chemical reactions using a syntax familiar to chemists and chemical engineers, without relying on external libraries.

## Data Types
- `Substance`: Represents a chemical compound or element.
- `Reaction`: Describes chemical reactions between substances.
- `Condition`: Specifies conditions under which reactions occur.

## Syntax
- Substance declarations: `Substance <name> = "<formula>";`
- Reaction syntax: `Reaction <name> = <reactant> + <reactant> -> <product>;`
- Applying conditions: `<reaction_name>.under(<condition>);`

## Example
Here is an example demonstrating the esterification process:
```pychem
Substance ethanol = "C2H5OH";
Substance aceticAcid = "CH3COOH";
Reaction esterification = ethanol + aceticAcid -> ethylAcetate + water;
esterification.under(heat(78Â°C), catalyst("H2SO4"));
esterification.execute();
```
