This Python program is a graphical user interface (GUI) designed to simulate a combination lock using three vertical sliders. The lock is initialized with a default combination of (1, 2, 3) for the three sliders. The first slider is initially set to 0, and when the correct value for each slider is reached in sequence (starting with the first slider), the next slider becomes enabled. The second slider is unlocked when the first slider reaches its designated value, and the third slider is unlocked when the second slider's value is correct. Once all three sliders are correctly set to the default combination (1, 2, 3), the Unlock button, which is initially disabled and red, becomes enabled and changes color to green, indicating that the lock has been successfully opened. If the user clicks the Unlock button after setting the correct combination, a success message is displayed in a text area, and the button remains green and disabled, preventing further interaction until the lock is reset.

The Reset button allows users to reset the sliders and the state of the program back to the initial conditions. Upon pressing the Reset button, all sliders are reset to 0, and the second and third sliders are disabled, ensuring that the user must start the unlocking process from the beginning. The Unlock button also resets to its initial state, becoming red and disabled again. The layout is designed with dark mode styling, and the buttons are placed side-by-side and centered below the text area to ensure a clean and accessible interface. The program also uses dynamic feedback: as the sliders are adjusted, the program continuously updates the state of the lock and the Unlock button, making the interface interactive and engaging. This combination lock program provides a simple but effective demonstration of using tkinter for GUI programming and event handling in Python.
